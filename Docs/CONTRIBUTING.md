# Contributing to Vibe Code Tracker

This is a personal reflection system, not an open-source project seeking contributors. However, if you fork it and want to share improvements, here are some ideas:

## Ideas for Forks

## Pull Requests

Not accepting PRs for the main repo. This is a personal tool template. Fork it, make it yours, share your fork.

## Philosophy

Keep it brutal. Keep it honest. Keep it simple.

If your fork loses the core purpose—surfacing uncomfortable truths—it's not Vibe Code Tracker anymore.
